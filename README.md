A Game of Rock Paper Scissors

## Status

***This project will no longer be worked upon.***

This is because the [Learning to Code](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56) section of the [Becoming a TOP Success Story](https://dev.to/i3uckwheat/series/16683) makes it clear to [only focus on the point of the assignment](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56) and that [foundations isn't a strong portfolio generator](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56).

## General Info

**rock-paper-scissors** is the [third project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) from the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

Here, I first create a game of "Rock Paper Scissors" which was originally played entirely in the console, then, later on, I update it to a full fledged browser based version with a graphical user interface.
